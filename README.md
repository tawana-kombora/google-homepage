# google-homepage

It's been illuminating trying to recreate google's search page. A lot more difficult than i anticipated but this method that requires research and experimentation suits my learning style well. I've learnt a lot more trying to get this to work than i have doing any exercises from courses.
I've also learnt that my biggest hurdle is inertia and even starting. Tasks that seem to biiig make me feel overwhelmed as i map out what i need to do.
I think I'll make this more "proffesional" eventually.
